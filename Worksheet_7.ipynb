        "Objective:\n",
        "The goal of this lab task is to develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python, reinforcing the students'\n",
        "understanding of:\n",
        " Control flow (if-else statements, loops)\n",
        " Functions\n",
        " Lists and indexing\n",
        " Input validation\n",
        " Game logic\n",
        "Task Details:\n",
        "You will create a Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players (Player X and Player O) take turns to mark a 3x3\n",
        "grid with their respective symbols (\"X\" or \"O\"). The game ends when one player wins by aligning their\n",
        "symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the game results in a tie.\n",
        "Instructions:\n",
        "1. Create the Tic-Tac-Toe board:\n",
        "o Use a list of 9 elements (initialized with empty spaces) to represent the 3x3 grid.\n",
        "o Write a function print_board() to display the current state of the board.\n",
        "2. Handle Player Input:\n",
        "o Write a function that asks the current player to choose a position (1-9) on the board.\n",
        "o Validate that the input is a number between 1 and 9 and that the chosen position is\n",
        "not already taken.\n",
        "3. Game Logic:\n",
        "o Implement a function to check if a player has won. A player wins if they have filled\n",
        "any one of the following combinations with their symbol:\n",
        " Rows: [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]\n",
        " Columns: [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8]\n",
        " Diagonals: [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]\n",
        "o Implement a function to check if the game has resulted in a tie (i.e., all positions are\n",
        "filled, and no player has won).\n",
        "4. Switch Turns:\n",
        "o Write logic to alternate between the two players (\"X\" and \"O\") after each valid move.\n",
        "5. Determine the End of the Game:\n",
        "o After each move, check if a player has won or if the game ends in a tie.\n",
        "o If a player wins, display a congratulatory message.\n",
        "o If it’s a tie, display a message indicating the draw.\n",
        "6. Replay Option:\n",
        "o At the end of the game, prompt the players with the option to play again or exit.\n",
        "Guidelines:\n",
        "1. You must write the following functions:\n",
        "o print_board(board): Prints the Tic-Tac-Toe board.\n",
        "o check_winner(board, player): Checks if the current player has won the game.\n",
        "o check_tie(board): Checks if the game ends in a tie.\n",
        "o get_player_input(player, board): Prompts the current player for a valid move\n",
        "o play_game(): The main game loop that controls the flow of the game.\n",
        "2. Validate all user inputs, ensuring they enter correct positions and avoid overwriting\n",
        "previously marked spots."

        "Problem Statement:\n",
        "You are tasked with developing a Python-based command-line application that simulates a\n",
        "robot navigating through a grid-based environment. The robot should find the shortest path\n",
        "from a specified starting point to a destination while avoiding obstacles placed within the\n",
        "environment. You will implement the A* pathfinding algorithm to compute the shortest path\n",
        "and visualize the result.\n",
        "Instructions:\n",
        "1. Environment Representation:\n",
        "o Use a 2D NumPy array to represent the environment (grid).\n",
        "o Free spaces will be represented by 0s and obstacles by 1s.\n",
        "o The user will input the grid size (rows and columns) and the number of\n",
        "obstacles with their locations.\n",
        "2. User Input:\n",
        "o Prompt the user to input the following:\n",
        " Grid size (number of rows and columns).\n",
        " Number of obstacles and their positions in the grid.\n",
        " Starting point (coordinates) for the robot.\n",
        " Destination point (coordinates) for the robot.\n",
        "3. A Pathfinding Algorithm*:\n",
        "o Implement the A* algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the\n",
        "destination.\n",
        "o The algorithm should calculate both:\n",
        " g: The actual distance traveled from the start point to the current point.\n",
        " h: The heuristic (Manhattan distance) from the current point to the\n",
        "destination.\n",
        " f = g + h: The total cost.\n",
        "o If no path is found, the program should display a message indicating that there\n",
        "is no valid path.\n",
        "4. Visualization:\n",
        "o After calculating the path, visualize the grid using matplotlib:\n",
        " Show the robot’s path from the starting point to the destination.\n",
        " Mark the obstacles, starting point, and destination clearly on the grid.\n",
        " Obstacles should be shown as black cells, the robot's path as red dots,\n",
        "the starting point as green, and the destination as blue.\n",
        "5. Data Management:\n",
        "o Use Pandas to display and manage the grid data before and after pathfinding.\n",
        "6. Bonus:\n",
        "o Provide the option for the user to retry with different start, destination, and\n",
        "obstacle positions without restarting the program."
